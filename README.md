# AWGG LAB SCRIPTS REPOSITORY

This repository contains scripts for the AWGG lab's most commonly employed bioinformatics pipelines and analyses.

To download a script, just open the script and click the **"raw"** button at the top of the script file. 
You can then copy and paste the script into your desired text editor.

If adding your own scripts please add the following comments to the top of the script where relevant:
- A line to describe what the script does
- Which program versions the script was created with
- What the typical compute requirements are for the script (RAM, CPUs, Walltime, Storage)
- Which programs/dependencies must be made available in the path for the script to work

Please ensure your scripts are softcoded i.e. other people will only have to change a number of variables at the top of your script in order for the script to work.
Variables should be general and self-explanatory e.g. **INPUT=R1.fastq.gz** rather than **INPUT=blood_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz**
